### Setting up ðŸš€

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Install `Bun` before proceeding. <br> > `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

There are two main components: `client/` and `anchor/` to set up. <br>
Before proceeding, run `bun i` to install the necessary dependencies for both directories. <br>
It is recommended to start with the `anchor/` first.

- For `anchor/`, please follow the instructions in the [`anchor/README.md`](./anchor/README.md). <br>
- For `client/`, please follow the instructions in the [`client/README.md`](./client/README.md).
